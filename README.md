# Public Data Extraction & Structuring Platform

## Problem
Government procurement and infrastructure data in India is spread across multiple portals such as GeM, CPPP, Railways, and PAIMANA.
These portals use different formats (PDFs, webpages, scanned documents) and inconsistent terminology, making analysis, transparency,
and decision-making difficult.

## Solution
This project aims to build an AI-powered pipeline that:
- Extracts data from public government portals (PDFs and webpages)
- Normalizes and standardizes tender and project information
- Deduplicates records across platforms
- Converts unstructured data into a clean, unified schema

The system will support Indic languages and enable analytics on tenders, vendors, project progress, delays, and cost overruns.

## Social Impact
- Improves transparency in government procurement
- Helps MSMEs easily discover relevant tenders
- Enables journalists and researchers to analyze public spending
- Assists government officials with data-driven oversight

## Open Source
This project is open-source and released under the MIT License.
Contributions are welcome.
